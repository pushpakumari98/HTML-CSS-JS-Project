<p>This project demonstrates a simple ON/OFF functionality for a bulb using JavaScript. When the button is clicked, it toggles the bulb image between ON and OFF states.</p>


<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
<p>The Bulb ON/OFF project is a straightforward example of how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. It helps understand event handling and updating the UI based on user interactions. The bulb starts in the ON state and changes to OFF when clicked, and vice versa.</p>

<br>
<b>Prerequisites</b>
<br>
<p>To run this project, you will need:</p>
<br>
<p>A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript</p>
<br>

<b>üìåInstallation</b>
<br>
1)Clone the repository or download the zip file using bash command

<br>
2)Navigate to the project directory.
<br>
<p>üìçbash</p>
 üëácd bulb-on-off
 <p>Ensure you have the bulb images (bulb-on.png and bulb-off.png) in the same directory as your HTML file.</p>
 
<br>

You will see a bulb image and two buttons labeled "Light ON" and "Light OFF".

Click the "Light ON" button to turn the bulb on and the "Light OFF" button to turn the bulb off.</p>
